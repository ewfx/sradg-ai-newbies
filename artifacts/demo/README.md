Hi Reviewers, We have uploaded 2 videos in the zip file, SInce the recorder we used is not able to switch between applications, so the first video has ppt explanation and it didnt switch to chainlit while giving the demo. We relaized it only after recording has ended... So recorded 2nd video with chainlit too. Hope this works and sorry for the inconvience
